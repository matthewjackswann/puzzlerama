Puzzlerama - Pipes 1
====================

Auto pipe solver for the Puzzlerama android app. It solves all of the Classic Pipes section.

This is done using an algorithm rather then storing the answers and entering them.

When the program is run a window will popup window will appear with a screenshot of the selected display. Draw a rectangle over the area containing your chosen android emulator and when the script sees a grid it can solve it will enter the solution.
You still need to press the next level button and clear any popups / ads
